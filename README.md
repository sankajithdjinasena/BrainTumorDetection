# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images using Deep Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify brain MRI images to detect the presence and type of brain tumor using deep learning techniques.

The classification task involves four classes:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor (Normal)

---

## 🏥 Clinical & Healthcare Relevance
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain. Due to the rigid structure of the skull, tumor growth can increase intracranial pressure, potentially causing brain damage and becoming life‑threatening.

Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment planning. MRI is the gold‑standard imaging technique, but manual analysis is time‑consuming and subjective. This project provides an AI‑assisted clinical decision support approach.
